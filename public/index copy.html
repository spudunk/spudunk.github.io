        Most web developers aren't blue collar.

        First I'll understand your business and needs.
        Then I'll help people online understand your business and service.
        I won't make things complicated.
        I'll make your online presence easy to find for everybody.
        You'll have more customers that know what they want,
        trust the quality of your brand,
        and appreciate what you stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll show you
        where your customers are coming from,
        how they find you,
        what they're searching for,
        how many find you on phones, computers,
        how many click on your website, phone number
        and more
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll make the effort to understand what your business needs to succeed.

        If you've ever tried them, simple website builders are affordable but look cheap.
        Custom basic 1 page websites cost around $600. You'll have to provide the written contents, pictures, basic
        layout, and examples you like. It takes about a month. This is a normal experience.
        We do things a little differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been painful seeing how difficult tech companies make it for small businesses to get online. There's
        either a communication barrier or a price barrier.
        Most businesses have similar goals. Most businesses need similar websites. Most businesses don't need a full
        time tech guy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build websites for $200. If you provide good pictures it will be better. If you tell me about your business it
        will be more personal.
        We'll talk breifly, I'll show you a few examples, you'll pick one and provide the content you want, I'll
        customize it for you.
        You'll have a website. It's that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to keep me around for updates and maintenance, plans start at $20 per month.
        That's less than my normal hourly rate. My goal is to make a difference and make websites accessible to every
        business.
        We can't let the big companies monopolize the internet.
