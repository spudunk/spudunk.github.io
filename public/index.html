      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>My name is Christopher Hicks. I am a web developer. I like to build things that are elegant, simple, and
        fast.
      </p>

      <p>My main focus is the user experience and function of a landing page.
        I build lean, clean websites that prioritize SEO, fast page loads, and user convenience.</p>

      <p>My goal is to build 100 websites for small businesses by the end of 2022.
        For most people these days, their phones are the primary way of finding goods and services.
        If your business needs more customers and doesn't have an effective web presence,
        contact me today to find out what I can do to help.</p>

      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>This website characterizes my builds. I don't put anything in the way of the content.
        Everything loads fast, even on slow connections. It's simple, to the point, provides
        the information you're looking for, and provides me with traffic statistics. </p>

        <h3>Landing Page - $200</h3>
        <p>
          I build websites starting at $200. Shop around and you'll realize that is a great deal!
          This is my expertise and how I plan to change the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is for a basic page like you see here.
          I provide a worksheet. You provide branding, content, and choose a basic theme.
          It will pass all applicable Lighthouse tests and look great on any modern device.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire process takes about a week on my end. It may take longer to get the
          content together and make design decisions if this isn't done.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Branding Consult - $200</h3>
        <p>
          To build a website, I need your branding guide. Without a mission statement, slogan, logo,
          color scheme, and content, there isn't much I can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise isn't branding, but I've done my research and put together a process
          for making a "good enough" branding guide to make an effective landing page.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Web Management - $50 / month</h3>
        <p>
          Don't let your website expire and get snatched up by a reseller, and don't let your content get stale!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll keep your website online, provide monthly traffic statistics, weekly updates,
          and make sure your hosting and domain renewals happen on time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Bigger Projects - $40 / hour</h3>
        <p>
          I'll admit, I'm not the best web developer for complex multi page apps with lots of
          functionality yet. My goal is to help small companies get online, not take online
          companies to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to discuss larger projects, and if I can't tackle them I will refer you
          to a designer who is great at what you want.
